# SnapTest Web App Documentation

## Project Overview

**SnapTest Web** is a browser-based version of the SnapTest mobile application, designed to help students generate intelligent, contextual exam practice questions (MCQs and Theory) from uploaded educational content. Users can upload textbook images, PDFs, or Word documents, which are processed through OCR for text extraction. Fireworks AI then generates customized questions. All user-generated data is stored and managed using Supabase.

Unlike the mobile version, SnapTest Web allows seamless access across desktop and mobile browsers, enabling students to study and practice without needing to install an app.

## Target Users

* Secondary school, college, and university students
* Learners preparing for entrance exams, finals, or standardized tests

## Core Features

### üîê Username-Based Authentication

* No email/password required.
* A unique **username** is used to create a session and access stored data.
* Acts as the user identifier in Supabase.

### üìÅ File Upload

* Supports uploading:

  * Multiple images (`.jpg`, `.png`)
  * PDF files
  * Word documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)
* Drag and drop or traditional upload UI for convenience.

### üìñ OCR Text Extraction

* Uploaded files are processed to extract readable content using OCR.
* Supports scanned textbook pages, typed PDFs, and documents.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Question Customization

* **Question Type**: Objective (MCQ) or Theory.
* **Quantity**: User selects how many questions to generate (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, max 30).
* User interface allows flexible adjustments before generating.

### üß† AI-Powered Question Generation

* Extracted text is sent to Fireworks AI.
* The API returns smart, contextual questions based on educational content.
* Prompts are dynamically constructed depending on type/length of extracted text.

### üìù Quiz Mode

* **MCQ Mode**: Users can answer questions interactively; scores are shown at the end.
* **Theory Mode**: Displays theory questions for study/reference purposes; no scoring involved.

### üîÑ Regenerate Questions

* Users can request new question sets from previously uploaded materials.
* Supports iterative learning and exploration.

### üíæ Question Management (Powered by Supabase)

* All generated question sets are automatically saved per user (username-based).
* Users can:

  * View question history
  * Delete individual question sets
  * Revisit previous sessions
